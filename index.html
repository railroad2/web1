    <strong>The War of Genesis</strong></a> 
is a computer game which was created in 1996 by Softmax, 
a company in <u>Korea</u>.  Obviously The War of Genesis is a great game. 
Yes it is. It has the most impressive story and interesting game system.
I played this game several times but it is still great.
However, I hope that this great game is spreaded widely and many other people
can play this.

So, I decided to remake this game with better graphics and system.
Since the game is 20 years old, its graphics, interface or system is a little
old school.
My purpose is to renew the game to feel modern with the same feeling of the
original game.

Anyway I am learning HTML. So followings are for my learing.
